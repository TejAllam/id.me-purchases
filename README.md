Analysis : 

// Design
Went with native HTML/CSS/JS \
Didn't use any Frameworks, could have used Angular but didn't want to complicate. \
Started with Table syntax but realized issues from an earlier project, went with mobile first using the Card layout. \
Uses Media queries to display either in Mobile or Desktop based on dimensions (  > 769px as deciding factor). \
Fetches content using Fetch API \
Once data is retrieved, it should be preprocessed to ensure confirmity. \
Content is written to DOM and images are fetched in order. \
